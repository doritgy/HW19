"""The ON DELETE CASCADE clause is used in foreign key
relationships to specify that when a record in the parent
table , like departments is deleted, all corresponding records
in the child table (where the foreign key is defined,
will also be automatically deleted.
This clause defends the integrity of the database, because if for example
the department_id in the referencing table will be deleted and the department_id
in the referenced table will still exist, no reference will exist to that field
and the database will have no integrity.
In a regular foreign key, you can delete the reference without the referenced field

""" THis code is building a table of random numeric numbers with 2 decimal digits after
the decimal poing, in 10 rows (from generate_series), with the incremental
primary key.
:: is casting the data type of the random_value field, so that the "round" clause will
 deliver a numeric field with 2 decimal places after the decimal point.
 "random()" is a function that delivers a floating-point number between 0 and 1.
 that's why we are multiplying the number by 100 to get numeric numbers
 between 0 and 100.
 "round" is rounding the random number that we got to the nearest value
 with 2 decimal places.
 generate_series tells the sql to produce 10 rows of the table, on each one
 an id and a random number
